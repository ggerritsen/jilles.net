In various different forms my blog has survived from way back in 2003 till now.
In the first couple of months, the blog would only run on my own computer (I
didn't have hosting back then). Now, I've redone the blog in Jekyll so that it
is completely statically generated (and pushed into GIT for convenience).

I've only deleted two articles that basically were going absolutely nowhere.
Besides that I believe most of the content came across in tact. Let me know
if you see problems anywhere.

As for the comments, I have backed them up and uploaded them to Disqus.
However, I have not finished the integration back into the blog yet. So check
back later.

**Update**: As of June 21st, the comments are back. Fire away!

With that, I intent to write more again as well. It's been a long time since I
have written anything sensible on any topic. The last real articles were
written on the difference between Dutch and Danish culture ([Part
I]({{site.baseurl}}/perma/2008/12/20/denmark-compared-to-the-netherlands/) and
[Part
II]({{site.baseurl}}/perma/2009/04/11/denmark-versus-netherlands-part-ii/)).
Currently living in Italy for over a year now so that is a logical start. In
any case, we will see. For now, enjoy the new site and let me know if there is
anything wrong.

If you would like to know more about how this blog is setup now, please [see
the colophon]({{ site.baseurl }}/colophon.html).
