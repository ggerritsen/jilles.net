Just removed my Plaxo account. Used it for a while, and found it useful now and
again. But since for over a year or so they started turning into this social
network, and I have plenty of those. I keep getting invites from others that do
use it, people commenting on pictures that I upload on Flickr (comments that
are posted on Plaxo), etc.
