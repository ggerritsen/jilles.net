While working on a draft article for this site I needed to collect some weird
images of myself which could then be used in a collage because one of my
colleagues is going to leave. I myself don't want to pick that image, and was
going to offer the creators of the collage the options. While not wanting to
send them megabytes of images, I thought I might do it the Web 2.0 way and put
them up on Flickr. Since someone is going to find them anyway, [I might as well
point you guys to
it.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jilles/sets/72057594109781558/)
