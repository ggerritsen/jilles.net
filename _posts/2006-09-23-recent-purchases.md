Recently made a few purchases, without doing so much as leaving the house. I
really love how that works, really convenient.

First off, I bought a new black, 2nd generation iPod Nano 8GB. I don't have a
ultra large music collection, but I really like the device's design (duh!) and
experience.

Second up, I am completely addicted to Lost nowadays and I just finished the
1st Season, so I bought the first part of Season 2 second hand off of <a
href="http://www.marktplaats.nl">Marktplaats.nl</a>. I am anxiously *not*
putting it in the DVD player because I know it will be a ~15 hour time drain
instantly.

And last but not least my first shipment of new books came in from Amazon,
including:

</div>


All except the "The Book of Atrix Wolfe" book came in, which I bought second
hand on Amazon.com. You can see my entire book collection at: <a

(<a href="http://ojilles.listal.com/rss/owned/books/">RSS feeds</a> are
available there as well).

*(Authors note, 2011: Don't bother with The Book of Atrix Wolfe, so abstruse, I could not get through the first 20 pages)*

All this should keep me quiet for a little while...
