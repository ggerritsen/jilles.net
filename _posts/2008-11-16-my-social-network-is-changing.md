<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/wp-content/img_0001-200x300.png" alt="Hyves social network screen shot on iPhone" title="img_0001" width="200" height="300" /></a>

Looking at this picture, I realized I was seeing a visualization of something
I've been telling people around me: that it seems _everyone_ in my social
circle is having a baby.  What you are looking at is one page of friends on a
local social network in the Netherlands called <a
href="http://www.hyves.nl">Hyves</a>. 

There are 6 babies depicted, out of the 12 possible (if you do not count some
of the adults as babies). In, as a should I add, a "_random_" screen shot. It
kind of underlines, for me, what has happened in the last 12 months: I can
count at least 25+ couples/individuals that have been pregnant. All of which
luckily delivered without any (lasting) incidents!

Now I should not be surprised by this of course, statistics will have it that
there are just not many 18 year olds that become pregnant, but still: it
happens so fast!

I guess these are the beginnings of a mid-life crisis?
