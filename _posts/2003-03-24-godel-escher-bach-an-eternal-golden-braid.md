I've got an edition of <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465026567/104-8640111-8926352?v=glance&amp;n=283155">_Godel,
Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid_</a> (GEB) by Douglas Hofstadter, a gift
from my parents. Two words about this book: **oh my!**. I'm currently also reading
_A storm of swords_ by Martin but I don't think I'll be able to read in that
book as long as I haven't finished <span class="caps">GEB</span>. I mean, if a
book like this can make a 23 yr old person fond of Zero 7, Yonderboy and Norah
Jones yearn to hear _Musical Offering_ by J.S. Bach. Damn.

Well, I'm only 50 pages into the book and it really gets my interest. I was
especially surprised that Hofstadter was able to make the same strange loops one
can find in Escher's drawings, Bach's music and Godel's math in the dialogues between
Achilles and Tortoise!

I don't get the clue of the last two paragraphs of the dialog between Achilles
and Tortoise for the second chapter. The part of accepting rules A, B but not Z
is not that hard to get but what I don't get is the "adopting pun"-part:

> "And would you mind, as a personal favor, considering what
> a lot of instruction this colloquy of ours will provide for the Logicians of the
> Nineteenth Century would you mind adopting a pun that my cousin the Mock-Turtle
> will then make, and allowing yourself to be renamed
> **TAUGHT**.

> 'As you please," replied the weary warrior, in the hollow tones of despair, as
> he buried his face in his hands."Provided that **YOU**, for **YOUR** part, will
> adopt a pun the Mock-Turtle never made, and allow yourself to be renamed a
> **KILL**-EASE!"

(from G.E.B. by Hofstadter)

That is the part I don't get. Are they setting up for the same conversation this
time about a comment the Mock-Turtle will make in the future, instead of two
sides of a triangle? Someone comment, track-back or mail me please!
