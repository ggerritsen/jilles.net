![French Onion Soup with lots of cheese!][ph20]

After having gone on a rampage for various different recipes ([small selection
here](http://pinboard.in/u:ojilles/t:recipies/)), I found the following recipe
on [Smitten Kitchen](http://smittenkitchen.com/2011/04/french-onion-soup/) and
thought I'd try that and share the results. So, to be clear, the recipe is
based on Smitten Kitchen's.

The soup is absolutely awesome though. And even better, the whole kitchen will
smell delicious while you are cooking it. To get started, grab the following:

* 1 1/2 pounds (680 grams) thinly sliced yellow onions
* 3 tablespoons (42 grams) unsalted butter
* 1 tablespoon (15 ml) olive oil
* 1 teaspoon (5 grams) table salt, plus additional to taste
* 1/4 teaspoon (1 gram) granulated sugar (helps the onions to brown)
* 3 tablespoons (24 grams) all-purpose flour
* 2 quarts (1.9 liters) beef or other brown stock
* 1/2 cup (120 ml) dry white wine or dry white vermouth
* Freshly ground black pepper

To start, grab your onions and chop them up in strips of 4-8mm each. Not too
big, not too thin. It is hard to make too many onions, so if you go a little
over, no worries.

Next, take the oil and butter and heat those up on "moderately low heat". Once
that is done, toss in all the onions. Stir them around to get them all oiled
up. Then close the lid, and just have it sit there. This should soften up your
onions (by keeping the moist inside).

Once done, turn up the heat to medium. Now we need to caramelize the onions.
This will make that awesome taste to the soup, so it's important to get right.
Basically, all you need to do is add the salt and sugar and  stir the onions
every other minute or so for the next 30-40 minutes.

For me it looked like this halfway through:

Once the onions are all caramelized, sprinkle the flower over the onions.
Before stirring, it should look roughly like follows:

I think using a little less than the ingredient lists calls for is okay, some
experimentation is needed here. Stir the flower through for 3 minutes.  Now it
is time to turn this into a real soup: add the white wine, wait a little bit,
then bit by bit add the stock to the mix. Add the pepper to taste, and a bit of
salt -- don't over do the latter. Now bring the whole thing to a simmer, and it
should look like this:

![Onion soup, needs another 30 Min's][ph12]

Put the lid back, but keep a small opening. Now this needs to simmer for
another 30-40 minutes. Check in once in a while, if you have a film on top of
the soup, skim it off. And that is it really! However, in my mind, French Onion
Soup is not done without the toast with cheese. I usually use the toaster to
make some bread crispy. I always put them up against each other vertically, to
avoid them getting moist prematurely:

![Nice crispy bread!][ph13]

At the same time, cut some remaining fresh onion up in really small pieces
(maybe one or two tea spoons). Get some cheese (being dutch, I used Gouda, but
most cheeses will work) and combine the onion and cheese.

After your 30-40 minute simmer is done, poor the soup in your ramekins/cups,
add the toast on top, and then the cheese/onion, like so:

![Soup and topping prepared][ph17]

This should go into a preheated oven, put to broil. Temperature isn't that
important (200-270 Celsius), as long as the cheese becomes brown! Should not
take too long, so just stay around and check in every minute or so. After that,
done!

Oh, and since you undoubtedly got left over white wine, don't forget to serve
that too!
