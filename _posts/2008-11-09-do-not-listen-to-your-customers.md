    I felt we should just talk to as many customers as possible, and do whatever
    they say. But that is a bad idea. It confuses the tactic, which is listening,
    with the strategy, which is learning.

(<a href="http://startuplessonslearned.blogspot.com/2008/10/when-not-to-listen-to-your-users-when.html">reference</a>)

Exactly! This is quite hard to do, though. What happens when there are multiple
people involved in the listening? People will fall into three categories:

* Not listening: don't listen to your customers at all, instead driving your own strategy
* Only listening: start executing on exactly what your customers are asking for
* Listening & thinking: listen to your customer, but define your own business strategy and stick with that

This of course, needs the quote by <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_ford">Henry Ford</a> about people
asking for a faster horse. It is while you listen to your customers you
validate and refine your strategy.

Draw up your own plan, validate it and stick with it: don't breed a faster
horse!
