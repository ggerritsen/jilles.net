Herewith a small post, that I will probably revisit later, about my Ski plans
for the upcoming season 2006-2007. See the below Google Map indicating the four
places that I am  most likely going to visit.

Can't wait to start skiing again! As I said, I'll probably do a another post
describing the exact plans and updating the map with images and the like.

*Update:* (2007-06-16). The one in Val Thorens didn't pull through, as it was
really close to the one in Zermatt and proved to be logistically improbable.
Anyway, 3 ski trips in one season is really helping your condition on the
slopes. Definitely recommended!
