Normally, I just follow my own Bloglines account, checking those blogs that I'm
subscribed to. I always try to force myself skip on as many posts I can. But
every once in a while I go on a rampage in search of new good blog (-posts).
Here is a round up.

* *Top ten things ten years of professional software development has taught me*:  lists the 10 things the author thinks software development has taught him. My favorite: "he business likes to say that all the features are as crucial. They are not. Push back and make them commit."
* Here is a post on *<a href="http://particletree.com/">Particletree</a>* (bookmark that site!) that talks through the <a href="http://particletree.com/features/loading-content-with-json/">4 ways of delivering JSON objects</a> from the server to the browser client. Also <a href="http://particletree.com/features/preloading-data-with-ajax-and-json/">this other post</a> that talks through paging through JSON/Ajax data plus preloading the data.
* <a href="http://particletree.com/notebook/business-model-roundup/">A nice aggregation of articles</a> talking about business models on the web
* Update: another <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/amazons_series_fortunate_events.php">really nice post on Amazon's technology</a> and what the advantage of using their systems give. _(I'm not completely buying into it, but that's a post for another time -- Microsoft shoving all their apps onto Amazon and Amazon not going to budge underneath the pressure??)_
