Something that I see going wrong quite often with the use of Graphite is the
order in which derivatives work in graphite. ([Function reference for nonNegativeDerivative](http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/0.9.12/functions.html#graphite.render.functions.nonNegativeDerivative))

> TL;DR: If you use `nonNegativeDerivative()` or `derivative()` put it as close

For example, if we have the following "raw" data in graphite:

![Raw data][pic1]

Basically, a bunch of counters across various different machines. Most likely,
you will want to see this derived and consequently summed or averaged out
(depending on what you are looking at of course). Quite often I then see
graphs like this:

![Problem chart with spikes][pic2]

The problem you see here is that due to any number of reasons the data got
disturbed and you see these spikes (in my example twice) which completely
obscures the real data (get's pushed to the x-axis).

Possible causes are:

* Servers were not able to push data to graphite
* Internal counters got looped b/c integer space
* Internal counters got reset b/c service restart (or similar)

How does this change our aggregated data? Due to the fact that we first sum the
different data sources, the data looks like this right before reaching the
`nonNegativeDerivative()` function:

![Summed data][pic3]

And indeed a proper derivation of this data would give you these spikes. The
solution to this is to put the `nonNegativeDerivative` closest to the data
source, like so:

From: `nonNegativeDerivative(sumSeries(cs-*.aggregation-cpu-average.cpu-user.value))`

To: `sumSeries(nonNegativeDerivative(cs-*.aggregation-cpu-average.cpu-user.value))`

The resulting graphs will be much more informative (without obscuring the fact
that the data collections were interrupted) and the derivations will work
properly.

(PS: You would not necessarily run into this problem if you only use one data
source. The problem arises from the fact that /after/ you aggregate the data,
individual counters that get wrapped or stopped reporting are not visible
anymore and the derivation will come the incorrect conclusions.)

_UPDATE August 18th, 2014_: Recently another handy function became available
called `perSecond`, which as far as I can tell is a combination of
`scaleToSeconds(nonNegativeDerivative(metric),1)`. Ends up being super helpful
if you have `*.count` metrics you would like to have expressed as per second.
See [perSecond](http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/functions.html?highlight=identity#graphite.render.functions.perSecond).
