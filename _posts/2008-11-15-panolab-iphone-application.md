Moving to a different country gives you more spare time, with which I can play.
Just installed PanoLab on my iPhone, and I must say it works great. See the two
examples below.

This is the Den Bla Avis building (the company that created http://www.dba.dk)
from their parking lot in the marina of Aarhus, Denmark:

These are three pictures stitched together on the iPhone itself (and cropped in
iPhoto on the MacBook Air).

The PanoLab application works great, stitching the photos together is really
user friendly. My only gripe with it is when exporting the results you need to
crop to a certain size--I just want to export the whole picture.
