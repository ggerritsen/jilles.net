I had this really old laptop which holds my "books database" and thought to
back it up. I was using some proprietary windows application to hold them all.
And instead of backing them up I brought them online using <a title="Listall's
website" href="http://www.listal.com">Listall.com</a>. The setup was a breeze
(even didn't require me to confirm my email address). The only problem I had
with Listall is that it is pretty US and UK centric, not finding my dutch books
at all (which constitutes less that 5% of my collection, so that is not that
big a problem).

You can find my book collection, alongside my ratings, etc, at: <a
