I make no presumptions on my blog: I hardly dedicate time and effort to it and just want some place to put some of my thinking on the intertubes. That said,<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/dir/jilles/oldenbeuving"> I do know a thing</a> or two about websites so I can't help myself applying some of the practices I learned on my weblog.

Here is a breakdown of which keywords people use to end up on my site:

* `kaprun austria`: When I got back from my ski trip, I <a
  href="javascript:;">posted
  a video and some pictures</a>. **EDIT 2011: this article has been removed**
* `php website architecture`  (and variations thereof like "`website
  architecture with PHP`"):  I've posted a few articles on this topic, ranging
  from a <a
  href="{{site.baseurl}}/perma/2008/04/28/pfcongrez_marktplaats_architecture/
  ">presentation of the high level architecture at Martkplaats.nl</a>, an
  article <a
  href="{{site.baseurl}}/perma/2007/05/29/memcached-discussions-bloglines-facebook/">about
  the use of Memcache at large deployments</a>. Most people <a
  href="{{site.baseurl}}/categories/Technology/">land at the
  category page</a> actually.
* `database versioning`: I've written exactly <a
  href="{{site.baseurl}}/perma/2003/10/17/database-versioning-techniques/">one
  article</a> about how to version databases in large applications (like very
  popular websites). It's a topic that has a lot of my interest (other topics
  are version control systems and relevance in search engines).
* `Westendorf map`: Each year I'm going down to Westendorf, Austria, for a
  ski holiday with a really nice group of people. Years ago I found this <a
  href="{{site.baseurl}}/wp-content/westendorf-map/">"interactive" map of
  Westendorf</a> that was based on an aerial photo that was usefully annotated.
  I copied the zip-file that was offered. Years later the original was gone, so
  I decided to <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/wp-content/westendorf-map/">upload it
  on my website</a> for others to use. The funny thing is, that another popular
  search for that page is the actual URL of the page.
* `CVS branching strategy`: As stated above, version control systems are a
  pet peeve of mine. I wrote an article asking the question "<a
  href="{{site.baseurl}}/perma/2004/10/06/what-branching-strategy-do-you-use/">What
  branching strategy do you use?</a>".
* `economic disaster`: Recently I wrote <a
  href="{{site.baseurl}}/perma/2008/11/08/economic-disaster-seriously/">a quick
  article</a> pointing to two blog entries on the <a
  href="http://blog.tomevslin.com/">Fractals of Change</a> weblog that is
  describing the current economic disaster in clear words.
