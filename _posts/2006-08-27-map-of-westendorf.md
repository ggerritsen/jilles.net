For the past 6 or 7 years I have gone to <a
href="http://homes.tiscover.com/prjt/westendorf/index2.html?_hm=1&_lang=en">Westendorf</a>,
Austria with friends and family for a week long wintersport holiday.
Westendorf not being the biggest city ever we quite know the place and always
book well in advance. This year however we couldn't book the 9 rooms we needed
in one of our usual places. Which brought up the question of "which other
apartments are there for rent and how close are they to the slopes?".

I remembered finding a map/photograph of Westendorf with all the apartments,
hotels, apres-ski bars  painted on it. I tried to find it again, but couldn't.
Booted up my really old laptop and found it there. So, in order to make sure
both I and you will be able to find it again in the future, I'm hosting a copy
here on the site. <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/wp-content/westendorf-map/">Go
check out the map of Westendorf</a>.

**Update**: Seems that this year we will be staying a week at <a
href="http://www.mesnerwirt.at">Mesnerwirt</a>, Westendorf. (Impression
video's: <a href="http://www.mesnerwirt.at/aussenansicht56k.htm">outside</a>,
<a href="http://www.mesnerwirt.at/zimmemesnerwirt56k.htm">room</a>, <a
href="http://www.mesnerwirt.at/wellnessmesnerwirt56k.htm">wellness</a>, <a
href="http://www.mesnerwirt.at/restaurantmesnerwirt56k.htm">restaurant</a> - we
have eaten here a lot over the last couple of years, great atmosphere!, and the
(in-)famous <a
href="http://www.mesnerwirt.at/kellermesnerwirt56k.htm">Kellerbar</a>!)

**Update 2**: Found some footage on YouTube of places where I have been. See:
*	A little piece of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-q3VLAegiA">the boarders playground</a> at Westendorf
*	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGth4vW-8eI">The 111th track</a>, which is a long (7km?) ski way that it fairly flat but where you can reach great speeds (unlike the guy filming the movie).
*	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKqmDb8ckXg&NR">The new Ki-West track</a>
*	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNj-sIbP2A">Tirolian folk dance</a>. This was recorded by someone I don't know but <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jilles/97292772/">last year I have been there myself as well</a>. Highly recommended!
