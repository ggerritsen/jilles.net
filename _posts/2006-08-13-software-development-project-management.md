Just ran across <a href="http://www.basilv.com">the site off Basil
Vandegriend</a>, who wrote <a
href="http://www.basilv.com/psd/blog/2006/understanding-project-schedules">an
article back in May</a> about project management for software development
projects. In that article he shows an <a
href="http://www.basilv.com/psd/software-files/launchManagementDiamond.html">application
that shows the relation between the four factors</a> that play a role in
project management: time, resources, scope and quality with which you can
visually show their relation.
