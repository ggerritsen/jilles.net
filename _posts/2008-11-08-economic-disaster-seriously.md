Recently found a weblog ("<a href="http://blog.tomevslin.com/">Fractals of
Change</a>") that occasionally talks about the finance world. There are some
really great gems. For example, take this article explaining "<a
href="http://blog.tomevslin.com/2008/10/the-physics-of.html">the physics of
money</a>":

> The faster we spend, the more money there is available in the economy. Money we
> put in our mattresses might as well not exist as far as the economy is
> concerned even though it may be very important to us.

<a href="http://blog.tomevslin.com/2008/11/the-glass-is-ha.html">Another
article</a> outlines the positive aspects of the current financial crisis:

> This correction from excess has been violent and in many ways harmful but it
> HAS cured many of the excesses; the goal shouldn't be to reestablish them. We
> don't want housing prices to boom out of reach again; we don't want oil prices
> to go up or credit to be extended promiscuously; we don't want a banking
> economy based on the third derivative of valueless debt.

Some of the other blog posts over there are interesting reads as well!
