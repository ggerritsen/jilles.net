I have lost my copy of "Godel, Escher, Bach" by Douglas Hofstadter, so I bought
a new one which I intent to reread. <a
href="{{site.baseurl}}/perma/2003/03/24/godel-escher-bach-an-eternal-golden-braid/">When
I first read it</a> in 2003, I had this amazing feeling afterwards but could
not quite attribute it to certain elements and topics in the book. The book as
a whole has a lot of qualities, but this time I'm going to keep a little log on
what resonates with me. I will try to write those down here for future
reference.
