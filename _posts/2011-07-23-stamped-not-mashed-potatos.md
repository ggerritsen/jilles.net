The other day I made a delicious potato dish, and having my camera ready, I
thought I'd share it with you! To go short, rather than baking potato disks, or
mashing them up completely, this dish nicely holds the middle. This produces a
really nice crunchy dish!

Ingredients:

* Potatoes (have them decently sized)
* Salt, pepper
* Herbs (Rosemary, or ...)
* Oil

For starters, boil the potatoes _in their skins_. That's important: in their
skins. This is what is going to make them so crunchy and good. You should add
some salt to taste. The best way to do that is to wait for the water to boil,
then add the salt. This works better as the water immediately dissolves it.
Start the oven or broiler. I put mine on 200-220 degrees C. Oil up a baking
plate. Once done, take out the boiled potatoes, put them on the plate and crunch
them with your potato stamper, like so:

![Die you potato, die!][ph2]

Stamp them till they are maybe 1 to 2 cm in height, not more. Make sure they are
jagged on top. Here, another example:

After you have done the lot, sprinkle some oil on top:

And add more salt on top of the potatoes, and your herbs. In the pictures you'll
see me experimenting with red onions: you are advised to skip that as it doesn't
work very well in the broiler.

After all this torture, the potatoes still have one last step: the oven. I
usually put my oven on "broil" at around 200-220 degrees. Since the potatoes are
already "done" (through the boiling) it all really doesn't matter too much.
What you are looking for is to harden up the outsides, the jagged tops, the
skins of the potatoes. This will make it really crunchy, while the inside is
still nicely soft like a boiled potato.

Just check the oven every few minutes till you are happy with the result. Here
was mine:

See all those brown bits?! Those are the best! Buon appetito!
