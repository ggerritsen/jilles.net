Today I did a few searches on Google, only to find out that Google either
rolled out a new feature to their Search Engine Result Page or is testing it. I
guess it is the latter because several <a

and friends were not able to replicate the behavior. See the screen shot below:

Basically Google remembers which searches you have done on a person by person
basis. However, only now did I also see that the number of times you have
already visited the search result is now displayed next to it.

After digging some deeper I found some more features. Here is a page showing
what I my popular searches were and which of the results were popular with me:

<a title="Popular Searches" href="{{site.baseurl}}/wp-content/google%20test%202.JPG"><img width="128" height="46" id="image30" alt="Popular Searches" src="{{site.baseurl}}/wp-content/google%20test%202.thumbnail.JPG" /></a>

And Google provides some handy graphs too!

<a title="Nice stats" href="{{site.baseurl}}/wp-content/google%20test%203.JPG"><img width="128" height="85" id="image31" alt="Nice stats" src="{{site.baseurl}}/wp-content/google%20test%203.thumbnail.JPG" /></a>

Some of this has implications though:

    <a href="http://www.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=26654&topic=1593">How is my Search History stored?</a>
    Personalized Search stores your search history on Google servers, which means you can view your history and get personalized search results on any computer.
